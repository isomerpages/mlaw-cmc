As the focus for the second CEP was on equipping the participants with 'Building Skills', the briefing conducted by CMU Manager, Mr Casen Ng focused on practical aspects of mediation. The briefing provided participants with knowledge about alternative dispute resolution as well as insight to mediation as a useful life-skill. A total of about 25 participants attended the training.

First National ADR Forum

About the ADR Advisory Committee

ADR is fast becoming a preferred means of settling disputes around the world, including Asia.

As part of Singapore's drive to be a regional hub for ADR services, MinLaw formed an ADR Advisory Committee in Jul 2004, to serve as a forum for feedback and input to develop Singapore's ADR infrastructure in a holistic and integrated manner.

The inaugural National Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Forum was held on Saturday, 15 Jan 2005 at The Raffles Hotel. The event was one of the initiatives of MinLaw's ADR Advisory Committee chaired by the Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee.
Chaired by Senior Minister of State for Law, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, the 21-member Committee comprises broad representation from ADR institutions, ADR practitioners, the Courts, academia and Government agencies.

The objective of the Forum was to bring members of the ADR community together to share information and network. It also sought to generate greater public awareness about ADR developments in Singapore.

A total of 206 guests including members of the judiciary, legal fraternity, academia, engineers, construction industry, real estate industry, banking industry, consumer organisations, ADR institutions and Government agencies attended the Forum.

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar in his opening speech highlighted Singapore's progress in the ADR area.

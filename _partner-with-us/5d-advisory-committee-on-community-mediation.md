<p style="text-align: justify">The Advisory Committee on Community Mediation (ACCM) was convened in September 2011 and chaired by former Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee. Members of the Committee are typically Master Mediators and above who are selected in view of their experiences and backgrounds in the community.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The ACCM advises and assists the CMC on initiatives to attract and ensure a sustainable long term supply of volunteers as well as public outreach efforts to heighten awareness of the CMC's services. They also help to strengthen the CMC's partnership networks so as to ensure the effective channeling of cases to the CMC for mediation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">TThe CMC mediators are volunteers who have been specifically selected, trained and appointed for a specific tenure by the Minister for Law.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The CMC voluntary panel is a key distinctive feature of the Singapore system. While those who volunteer to assist in CMC mediation are typically individuals who have a heart from the community and take pride in rendering their services pro bono, the CMCâ€™s system of volunteer management takes cognizance of the importance of volunteer recognition and professional development and this is done through the Mediator Management Framework.</p>

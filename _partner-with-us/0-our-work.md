Outreach to the community involves ensuring that the residents in Singapore are aware of the availability of CMCâ€™s services. More than awareness, it is important to educate the public on the significance of using conflict self-management techniques to manage their conflicts effectively.

For social, family and community disputes that cannot be resolved on their own, it is equally important that such residents know of the availability of community mediation service to assist them. To do this, the CMC uses the two-pronged approach of leveraging on its close working relationship with its strategic partners and its online visibility to publicise its services.

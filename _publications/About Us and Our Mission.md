<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>The CMC is a centre under the Ministry of Law. As part of our goal in
providing access to justice, we are here to help residents in Singapore
resolve disputes, foster positive and harmonious relationships within our
communities, keeping tensions on the ground low and promoting greater understanding
among one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Managed by full-time public service officers of the Ministry of Law, our
role is to be responsible for the operations, administration, and management
of the CMC. We handle everything from the administration of mediation cases
and the management of our Volunteer Mediators to publicity, outreach work,
and other administrative matters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the CMC, we provide a valuable alternative for residents to address
and resolve conflicts, ensuring that community ties are strengthened and
preserved. By offering a neutral space for open dialogue, we aim to transform
disputes into opportunities for mutual understanding.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>To provide an attractive, practical and convenient solution for relational
and community disputes in Singapore.</p>

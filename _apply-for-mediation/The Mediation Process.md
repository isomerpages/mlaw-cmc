<h2>The Mediation Process</h2>

<p style="font-family:arial;">Mediation at the CMC is an informal and voluntary process that is conducted in a private setting. It is done in the presence of one or two professionally trained volunteer mediators.</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">During mediation, the mediator will listen as parties explain the issues in conflict. Through joint or private session, the mediator will define the issues in conflict, clarify the partiesâ€™ positions and interests and guide the parties towards coming up with their own solutions.</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">The process flow of the mediation procedure is as shown in the flow chart below.</p>

## Mediation at the CMC

<p style="text-align: justify">We provide mediation service to residents in Singapore who face social, relational and community disputes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Mediation at the CMC is an informal and voluntary process that is conducted in a private setting. It is done in the presence of one or two professionally trained volunteer mediators.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">During mediation, the mediator will listen as parties explain the issues in conflict. Through joint or private session, the mediator will define the issues in conflict, clarify the partiesâ€™ positions and interests and guide the parties towards coming up with their own solutions.</p>

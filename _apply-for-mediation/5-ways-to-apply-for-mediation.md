Ways to Apply
---

All requests or referrals for mediation are handled by officers at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC). Our officers are trained to assess if the nature of dispute is suitable for mediation at the Centre. If you have a dispute and wish to try mediation, there are 2 ways that you can register your case with us:

If you are an individual and wishes to apply for a mediation, click on [Direct Apply](/e-services/apply-online/){:target="_blank"}.

If you are a public officer from any government agency, non-governmental organisation or voluntary welfare organisation, click on [Referral by Agency](/e-services/refer-a-case-to-cmc/){:target="_blank"}.

Once both parties agree to mediation, a session can be arranged.

<h2>Mediation at the CMC</h2>
<p>We provide mediation service to residents in Singapore who face social,
relational and community disputes.</p>
<p>Mediation at the CMC is an informal and voluntary process that is conducted
in a private setting. It is done in the presence of one or two professionally
trained volunteer mediators.</p>

<p>During mediation, the mediator will listen as parties explain the issues
in conflict. Through joint or private session, the mediator will define
the issues in conflict, clarify the partiesâ€™ positions and interests and
guide the parties towards coming up with their own solutions.</p>

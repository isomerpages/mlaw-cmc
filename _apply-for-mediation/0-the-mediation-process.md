Mediation at the CMC
---

We provide mediation service to residents in Singapore who face social, relational and community disputes.
 
Mediation at the CMC is an informal and voluntary process that is conducted in a private setting. It is done in the presence of one or two professionally trained volunteer mediators.

During mediation, the mediator will listen as parties explain the issues in conflict. Through joint or private session, the mediator will define the issues in conflict, clarify the partiesâ€™ positions and interests and guide the parties towards coming up with their own solutions.

The Mediators Portal, launched on 1 December 2014 is an initiative to assist CMCâ€™s volunteer mediators.
<br><br>
 
Mediators can look forward to using the following functions in the Portal which includes:

<ul>
  <li>Viewing and updating their personal particulars</li>
  <li>Viewing and tracking their own performance</li>
  <li>Indicating interest for suitable mediation sessions</li>
  <li>Registering for mediation training and workshops</li>
  <li>Exchanging ideas and discussing with fellow mediators through a forum discussion.</li>
</ul><br><br>

To access the Portal, mediators would need to login with individual SingPass ID and password.  

For mediators without a SingPass, one can be applied via [www.singpass.gov.sg.](www.singpass.gov.sg)


For mediators who encounter problems through the use of the Portal, you can reach us via Contact Us @ OneMinLaw.<br><br>

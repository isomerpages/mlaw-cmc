<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>At the CMC, our mediators are not just your ordinary volunteers; they
are carefully selected, trained and officially appointed, enabling them
to work with you to foster understanding and resolve disputes.</p>
<p>Managed in accordance with the Community Mediation Centres Act (Cap49A),
structured frameworks and the Mediatorsâ€™ Code of Conduct, our mediators
undergo extensive training and continuous development. This ensures they
have the skills and knowledge needed to guide you through the mediation
process.</p>
<p>Our mediators are also committed to remaining active and engaged. Based
on their experience and expertise, they can progress through different
stages of mediation proficiency. As a SIMI Qualifying Assessment Provider
(QAP), we provide our mediators with opportunities to elevate to higher
SIMI accreditation, ensuring they meet the highest standards in mediation
practice.</p>
<p>So, whether you are facing a community dispute or you are seeking a peaceful
resolution, know that you are in the good hands of our dedicated mediators.
Let us navigate this journey together towards a more gracious and harmonious
living environment for all through open communication, with empathy and
consideration for each other.</p>

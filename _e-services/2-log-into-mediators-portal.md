Mediators Portal

**To log on to the Mediators Portal, please click here.**

The Mediators Portal, launched on 1 December 2014 is an initiative to assist CMCâ€™s volunteer mediators.

Mediators can look forward to using the following functions in the Portal which includes:
* Viewing and updating their personal particulars
* Viewing and tracking their own performance
* Indicating interest for suitable mediation sessions
* Registering for mediation training and workshops
* Exchanging ideas and discussing with fellow mediators through a forum discussion.

To access the Portal, mediators would need to login with individual SingPass ID and password.  

For mediators without a SingPass, one can be applied via [www.singpass.gov.sg](www.singpass.gov.sg).

For mediators who encounter problems through the use of the Portal, you can reach us via [Contact Us @ OneMinLaw](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/eservices/enquiry/).  

The Mediators Portal works best on the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 9.0 and above
* Mozilla Firefox
* Google Chrome
* Safari

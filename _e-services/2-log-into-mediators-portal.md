**To log on to the Mediators Portal, please [click here](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/eservices/cmc/mediatorsportal/login){:target="blank"}

The Mediators Portal, launched on 1 December 2014 is an initiative to assist CMCâ€™s volunteer mediators.

Mediators can look forward to using the following functions in the Portal which includes:
* Viewing and updating their personal particulars
* Viewing and tracking their own performance
* Indicating interest for suitable mediation sessions
* Registering for mediation training and workshops
* Exchanging ideas and discussing with fellow mediators through a forum discussion.

To access the Portal, mediators would need to login with individual SingPass ID and password.  

For mediators without a SingPass, one can be applied via <a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/spauth/login/loginpage?URL=%2F&TAM_OP=login">www.singpass.gov.sg</a>.

For mediators who encounter problems through the use of the Portal, you can reach us via <a href="https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/eservices/enquiry/">Contact Us @ OneMinLaw</a>.

The Mediators Portal works best on the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 9.0 and above
* Mozilla Firefox
* Google Chrome
* Safari

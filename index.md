notification: From 2 Jun 2020, the Ministry of Law Services Centre will operate
  from Mondays to Fridays, 8.30 -5pm (Last ticket will be issued at 4.30pm). In
  line with the current safe distancing measures, we will limit the number of
  visitors to our Services Centre, even as all our services remain accessible to
  the public, with digital and call services as the primary modes of working. As
  we will be working on reduced staff strength, longer waiting time is expected
  at the Services Centre. Members of the public are therefore encouraged to use
  our e-services to reach us or call 1800-2255 529. If you and/or accompanying
  persons are unwell with flu-like symptoms, please refrain from visiting the
  Ministry of Law Services Centre. For a list of legal support resources
  available during this period, click here. If you are a law practice, please
  refer to this advisory to see how these measures affect you.

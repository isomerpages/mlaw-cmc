<h3>What distinguishes mediation at the CMC from others, is our focus on repairing relationships between disputing parties.</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Community Mediation Centre (CMC), a centre under the Ministry of Law
(MinLaw), offers mediation service to residents in Singapore facing relational
and community disputes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through a facilitated process, our mediators help parties to communicate
the issues that matter to them, with the aim of uncovering what is at the
core of their interest.</p>
<p>Through joint and private sessions, the purpose of mediation is to foster
greater understanding between disputing parties, arrive at mutually acceptable
solutions and hopefully preserving relationships as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Resolving one dispute at a time, we are focused on building a more gracious
and harmonious living environment for residents in Singapore.</p>
<p>The CMC is managed by full-time MinLaw officers, who are responsible for
the administration and management of the CMC and augmented by a panel of
trained and experienced volunteer community mediators.</p>

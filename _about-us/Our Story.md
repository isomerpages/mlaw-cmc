<p>The CMC is a centre under the Ministry of Law (MinLaw). As part of ongoing
efforts to enhance access to justice, we are here to help residents in
Singapore resolve disputes effectively and foster a more gracious and harmonious
living environment for all through open communication. This ensures that
relationships are preserved.</p>
<p>The CMC is managed by full-time MinLaw officers, who are responsible for
the operations, administration, and management of the CMC. We handle everything
from the administration of mediation cases and the management of our Volunteer
Mediators to publicity, outreach work, and other administrative matters.</p>
<p>We have provided valuable alternative for addressing and resolving conflicts
amicably while ensuring that community ties are strengthened and preserved.</p>
<p>By offering a neutral space for open dialogue, we aim to transform disputes
into opportunities for mutual understanding.</p>

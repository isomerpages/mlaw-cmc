**To provide an attractive, practical and convenient solution for social and community disputes in Singapore.**

The two “Cs” in the logo symbolise the disputing parties. The “M” represents the mediator acting as the uniting force. The gradient arc reflects CMC’s mission to bridge fissures caused by conflict and contention. The colours of the arc ranges from dark to light to convey a sense of resolution. The dark blue letters connotes stability and reliability of the CMC. Grey connotes neutrality. The arc’s warm, rich and earthy colours lend an air of friendliness, approachability and optimism.

<ul style="text-align: justify">
  <li>Mediation training and assessment can lead to SIMI Accredited Mediator Level 1 for its volunteers (SIMI Registered Training Program)</li>
  <li>As a SIMI Registered Service Provider, mediation service is conducted professionally and impartially per SIMI standards.</li>
  <li>Post Mediation Experience Assessment is recognized for those who wish to become a SIMI Certified Mediator.</li>

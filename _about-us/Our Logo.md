<p>The two “Cs” in the logo symbolise the disputing parties. The “M” represents
the mediator acting as the uniting force. The gradient arc reflects CMC’s
mission to bridge fissures caused by conflict and contention. The colours
of the arc ranges from dark to light to convey a sense of resolution. The
dark blue letters connotes stability and reliability of the CMC. Grey connotes
neutrality. The arc’s warm, rich and earthy colours lend an air of friendliness,
approachability and optimism.</p>

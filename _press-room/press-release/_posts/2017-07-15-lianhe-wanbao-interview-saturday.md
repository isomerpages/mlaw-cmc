Lianhe Wanbao Interview, 15 July 2017, Saturday
---

Mr Stephen Poh, Master Mediator with the CMC was interviewed by Lianhe Wanbao. The article was published on 15 July 2017, Saturday.

**Lecturer refused to support parents to maintain yacht**<br>
***Angered elderly father seeks help from mediation centre***

The yacht needs maintenance, while the children’s swimming lessons and the housing loan need to be paid. These were the reasons cited by a male lecturer who insisted he had “no money” to support his elderly parents. This angered his elderly father, who then approached the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) for help to seek living expenses from him.

Stephen Poh, a 73-year-old retiree who is an experienced volunteer mediator with the Community Mediation Centre, had been helping out at the CMC since 19 years ago. He has mediated for various types of disputes.

In an interview with WB, he shared that the most common disputes handled were those of conflicts between neighbours. However, there were also cases of family disputes that the CMC handled. The case mentioned earlier was one that left a deep impression on Poh.

Poh recounted how the elderly man shared his situation, “The elderly man was getting on in years and he stayed with his wife. The elderly couple had no means of supporting themselves, but none of their children were willing to take care of them”.

During the mediation session, the elderly man’s children were all gathered. Poh maintained neutral and objective, sharing with the children how their father had brought them up with great pains. Now, the elderly man needed living expenses. Poh guided the children to consider how they could improve the life of their father.

He said that the children had their own families, and were from different backgrounds. One of the sons admitted that he was a lecturer but right from the start, he said he had tight finances.

“He said he needed to maintain a yacht, needed to pay for the swimming lessons for his children, and the housing loan had yet to be repaid. So he said he had “no money” for his father.”

**Promised to give $200 monthly after several rounds of mediation**

Poh said after several rounds of mediation, the son understood the father’s difficulties. The son agreed to give his father $200 monthly for living expenses.

Finally, several of the elderly man’s children came to an agreement to commit a total of $1,600 monthly for their father’s living expenses, and they signed a mediation agreement.

Poh admitted that the case made him understand how some children could ignore the needs of their parents, and he felt disheartened about this. However, he gained satisfaction from the mediation experience.

“Before leaving, the elderly man was teary-eyed and he thanked me. I felt deeply that the meaning of being a mediator is to be able to help the helpless.”

**Mediator: Need to learn how to tolerate and improve from mistakes**

Describing how people were like pencils and erasers where those who made mistakes must be given a chance to improve, Poh said there is a need to learn to be more accommodating.

Poh shared that when mediating any case, mediators need to maintain neutrality, and avoid providing any solutions to disputes.

“Mediation aims to allow the disputing parties to share their inner thoughts in a comfortable environment. Our job as mediators is mainly to listen to them and share similar cases, or help provide options, so as to guide the disputants into finding constructive solutions to their disputes. However, we will not make any judgment or provide a resolution to the problems. “

However, there are some who hold on to the mentality that they were “always right”, even as they come to the CMC. When they do, Poh would share the analogy.

“I once said, every pencil has an eraser attached to it. This is just like how when we make mistakes, we ought to be given a chance to change. I use this analogy to help them understand that there is a need to learn to be tolerant.”

Poh would also remind the disputants to try to achieve a win-win outcome, and avoid going to court. “Otherwise, there will certainly be a winner and a loser, and the outcome is decided by the judge.”

**More than 8,000 cases mediated with success rate of about 75%**

Since its inception in 1998, the CMC has mediated more than 8,000 cases, with the rate of success at about 75%.

According to CMC’s figures, 73% of the cases handled in 2015 were disputes between neighbours, while 13% of cases were those between family members or friends.

Speaking at the CMC’s Mediators’ Appointment Ceremony and Appreciation Dinner last November, Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law Indranee Rajah said that to help the mediators handle the increasingly complex cases received, the centre encouraged mediators to upgrade their skills in their lifelong learning journey.

Since 2013, the CMC sponsored 80% of the fees for training for eligible mediators to participate in courses relating to mediation. This year, five mediators received sponsorship to attend the Certificate in Law for Community Mediators programme at Temasek Polytechnic. This brings the total number of sponsored mediators to 15.

**Where to seek help if mediation is needed for disputes?**

The CMC is located at the URA Centre at 45 Maxwell Road, #07-11, The URA Centre (East Wing), Singapore 069118.

<b><u>PRESS RELEASE</u></b>

**The Community Mediation Unit also welcomed 18 new volunteer mediators and reappointed 130 mediators**

The Community Mediation Unit (CMU), a department under the Ministry of Law, held its annual Mediatorsâ€™ Appointment Ceremony and Appreciation Dinner on 17 July 2012 (Tuesday) at Grand Park City Hall. Senior Parliamentary Secretary (SPS) for Education and Law, Ms Sim Ann, was the Guest-of-Honour at the event.

 

2          The event was an occasion for the CMU to recognise the contributions of its panel of over 100 community mediators, who tirelessly volunteered their time and effort to facilitate the resolution of social and community disputes at the Community Mediation Centres. In 2011, these volunteers mediated close to 600 cases, with about 70 per cent of the cases resolved successfully.

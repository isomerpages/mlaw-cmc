Relocation of Community Mediation Centre (Regional East)
---

11 Jun 2006

The Community Mediation Centre (Regional East) ("CMC RE") located at Marine Parade District Hall moved its operations back to the Community Mediation Unit's Headquarters located at URA Centre East Wing, as of 28 February 2007.

CMC's operations at Community Mediation Centre (Central) located at URA Centre East Wing, Community Mediation Centre (Regional North) located at Woodlands Civic Centre and Community Mediation Centre (Subordinate Courts) ("CMC (Sub Courts)") located within the Subordinate Courts' premises will remain unchanged.

With effect from 28 Feb 2007, CMC RE located at Marine Parade District Hall moved its operations back to the CMU's HQ.

As part of an overall operational restructuring of the CMCs, CMC RE's move will free up the additional volunteer and manpower resources to step up CMC's mediation services at its Subordinate Courts centre as well as to roll out more public education and awareness programmes.

CMC's caseload has experienced steady increases over the years at all Centres since its inception. In particular, since its establishment in May 2004, CMC (Sub Courts) has mediated more than 670 cases with a success rate of two out of three mediations.

In tandem with CMC RE's move, starting from March 2007, Magistrate referral arrangements at CMC (Sub Courts) will extend from its current two days a week to three days a week. CMC hopes to eventually extend such referral arrangements to five days a week.

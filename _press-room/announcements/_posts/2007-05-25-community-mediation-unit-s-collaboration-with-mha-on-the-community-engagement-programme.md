Community Mediation Unit's collaboration with MHA on the Community Engagement Programme
---

25 May 2007

On 16 Apr 2007, Community Mediation Unit (CMU) collaborated in a pilot training programme organised by the Community Engagement Directorate, Ministry of Home Affairs and the Home Team Academy to brief and train a pilot group of civil servants working on the Community Engagement Programme (CEP) in the CEP cluster lead agencies, including Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, People's Association and Singapore Police Force.

This pilot training programme was intended to enable officers from the CEP clusters to better appreciate the security threat posed by terrorism and other risks and share best practices in building community trust and social cohesion. In addition, the programme was designed to help these officers initiate new ways to engage the community and for them to play a more proactive role in building social and national resilience in preparation for any national crisis.

In line with the programme objectives, CMU gave these officers an overview of mediation and specifically, the mediation work undertaken at the Ministry of Law's Community Mediation Centres. We also shared with the participants the significance of mediation in resolving community conflicts in Singapore.

Going forward, MHA plans to roll out the training programme to the CEP community leaders. CMU will continue to lend our support to this worthwhile community initiative.

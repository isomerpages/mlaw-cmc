Undergraduates Help Spread Peer Mediation to the Young
---

11 Jan 2007

A student equipped with peer mediation skills can change the way he and his fellow schoolmates resolve conflicts in and outside of schools.

To encourage this spirit of mediation among the youth, the Community Mediation Unit (CMU) met with a team of Singapore Management University (SMU) Business School undergraduates on 15 February 2007 to offer guidance on the running of peer mediation programmes, and to provide pointers on training methods that the undergraduates might adopt to effectively impart mediation skills to the young.

In turn, the team of six SMU undergraduates will coach a group of Primary Four and Five prefects from a local primary school in leadership, team building and peer mediation skills, as a module under their tertiary curriculum.

 As part of a long term strategy to nurture a mediation culture, the CMU will continue to engage and lend support to such volunteer efforts to promote greater public awareness about mediation and its benefits.

CMC makes airwaves
16 Mar 2005

Our Community Mediation Centre (CMC) made news recently when it was featured in the popular MediaCorp TV's Channel 8 Chinese drama serial "Double Happiness II".

Community mediation messages were woven into the serial's storyline and broadcast over three days: 2, 3 & 6 Dec 2004 at 7.00pm over Channel 8. This was done as part of CMC's strategic thrust to use the media as a platform to educate the public on CMC's services and the benefits of mediation.

Masterfully crafted by MediaCorp's scriptwriters, the three episodes highlighted how Jiayu's (acted by Aileen Tan) family got into a dispute with her next-door neighbour following a minor misunderstanding which resulted in inconsiderate behaviour by both neighbours.

The neighbours were then introduced to the CMC by their Residents' Committee. Both sides met at the CMC and helpful mediators helped them to settle the dispute amicably.

According to Taylor Nelson Sofres' (TNS) research findings, an average of 804,000 people (4 years old and above) viewed the episodes on community mediation over the three days. On 6 Dec 2004 when we aired the main mediation episode, our messages reached out to 830,000 people (4 years old and above). For those who missed viewing the broadcast, below are some television screen shots of the episodes.

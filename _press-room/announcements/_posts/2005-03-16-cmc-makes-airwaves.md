CMC makes airwaves
16 Mar 2005

Our Community Mediation Centre (CMC) made news recently when it was featured in the popular MediaCorp TV's Channel 8 Chinese drama serial "Double Happiness II".

Community mediation messages were woven into the serial's storyline and broadcast over three days: 2, 3 & 6 Dec 2004 at 7.00pm over Channel 8. This was done as part of CMC's strategic thrust to use the media as a platform to educate the public on CMC's services and the benefits of mediation.

Masterfully crafted by MediaCorp's scriptwriters, the three episodes highlighted how Jiayu's (acted by Aileen Tan) family got into a dispute with her next-door neighbour following a minor misunderstanding which resulted in inconsiderate behaviour by both neighbours.

Centralisation of Regional Centres

As featured in the Dec 2011/Jan 2012 issue of *The Mediator*, CMU will be centralising its operations which will see our Regional North and Central centres decommissioned in favour of a larger setup at The Treasury building located along High Street. Throughout our history, several changes have been made to reflect prudence in the management of our resources as well as to strategically poise ourselves to serve the members of the public more effectively.

On 9 March 2012, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minster for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, officially opened the new CMC (Central). Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, our mediators and partners joined us at the official opening. With our new centre we look forward to opening a new chapter to help develop a more harmonious, civil and gracious community by providing a suitable and accessible platform for the public to resolve differences amicably.

The move to The Treasury is the latest adjustment. Preparations started months ahead of our targeted starting date of operation (i.e. 13 February 2012) from The Treasury. During this time, earnest effort was put in to expeditiously complete the renovations to our new office. Typical of any major move, there were numerous tie-ups that needed to be done, from the simple cancelling of our cleaning services, phone lines, to informing all our partners of our relocation. It was also an opportune time to ‘spring clean’ the two centres. Yet in the midst of all this, work carried on as per normal. Thankfully, it was not long after before the day of the move finally arrived. With all our things packed, boxed and arranged in the metal cages, we moved “lock, stock and barrel” to our new home – The Treasury.

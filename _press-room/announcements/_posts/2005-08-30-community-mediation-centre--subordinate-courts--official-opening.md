Community Mediation Centre (Subordinate Courts) Official Opening Ceremony
---

30 Aug 2005

The Official Opening Ceremony of the Community Mediation Centre (Subordinate Courts) was held on Friday, 15 July 2005 at the Atrium of the Subordinate Courts. This new CMC was officially opened by Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee and witnessed by Senior District Judge, Mr Richard Magnus.

In SMS's opening address, he took the opportunity to thank the Courts, and especially SDJ, for their support and partnership with MinLaw in our community effort.

The official unveiling of the plaque was followed by a site visit to the CMC (Subordinate Courts) and a tea reception hosted by SMS for the guests.

The Ceremony generated significant publicity in the major mass media such as The Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao, MediaCorp Radio FM93.8 and FM95.8.

This new CMC is the result of a year-long collaborative effort between Community Mediation Unit and the Subordinate Courts. The facility first commenced pilot operations twice weekly in May 2004, focusing on mediating cases referred from Magistrates to the CMC. The facility is now on full scale operations along the lines of the other CMCs.

The co-location of a CMC at the Subordinate Courts makes it possible for suitable cases involving relational disputes to be referred to CMC immediately after the parties appear before the Magistrates. In the past, a separate session had to be arranged for another day.

This arrangement has brought about greater synergy between the CMC mediation service and the Court referral process and it affords disputants with a seamless dispute resolution process.

Community mediation has come a long way since we set up our first CMC in Marine Parade. With this new CMC facility, we now have four main CMCs and seven satellite mediation venues, manned by a pool of dedicated volunteer mediators.

We hope that over time, more Singaporeans will use mediation as an avenue of first resort to resolve their various community and social disputes.

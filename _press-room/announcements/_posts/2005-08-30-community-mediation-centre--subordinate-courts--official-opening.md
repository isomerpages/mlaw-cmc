---

30 Aug 2005

The Official Opening Ceremony of the Community Mediation Centre (Subordinate Courts) was held on Friday, 15 July 2005 at the Atrium of the Subordinate Courts. This new CMC was officially opened by Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee and witnessed by Senior District Judge, Mr Richard Magnus.

In SMS's opening address, he took the opportunity to thank the Courts, and especially SDJ, for their support and partnership with MinLaw in our community effort.

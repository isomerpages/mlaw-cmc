<p>In celebration of Singapore's Golden Jubilee, the CMC has put together
a collection of 50 community mediation stories, Mending Fences, Building
Bridges, as told by our mediators.</p>
<p>Through these stories, they share their perspective and impart valuable
lessons that we can all learn from. These stories provide insight to the
nature of social and community conflicts in Singapore, the lessons highlighted
in each story also provide an opportunity for reflection about how each
of us can play our part in keeping peace in our community.</p>

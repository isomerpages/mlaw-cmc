<p>While mediation is often seen as a formal process, our approach at the
CMC is different. We focus on the relational aspect of the parties involved,
aiming to foster mutual understanding and preserve relationships.</p>
<p>Our mediation service is offered at no cost to all residents in Singapore.
Mediation is also made accessible for everyone. We have mediators who can
conduct mediation sessions in various local languages and dialects.</p>
<p>We offer you a neutral and safe space where our trained mediators guide
you towards amicable resolution by finding common ground.</p>
<p>During mediation, our mediators actively listen to your concerns and perspectives.
Through collaborative discussions and guided sessions, they will work with
you to define the issues, clarify positions and interests, and explore
creative solutions tailored to your unique needs and circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Our aim is to empower you to resolve your dispute and move forward positively.</strong>

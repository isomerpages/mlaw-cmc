is different. We focus onthe relational aspect of the parties involved,
aiming to preserve post-conflict relationships and fostermutual understanding.</p>

<p>Our service is available to all residents in Singapore, offering you a
safe and inclusive space whereyou can find solutions that work for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We take pride in making mediation accessible to all residents by providing
sessions</p>
<p>not only in English but also in the various local languages and dialects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our professionally trained mediators are here to support you every step
of the way, ensuring that you get anopportunity to be heard and respected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During mediation, our mediators actively listen to your concerns and perspectives.
Through collaborativediscussions and guided sessions, they will work with
you to define the issues, clarify positions andinterests, and explore creative
solutions tailored to your unique needs and circumstances.</p>

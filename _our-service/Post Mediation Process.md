<p>You can apply for <strong>voluntary remediation</strong>  <u>one month after the last mediation session</u> through
our online application <a href="https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/cmc/mediatorsportal/direct-intake/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">form</a>.
You can also apply by calling the MinLaw Enquiry Line at 1800 2255 529*
during office hours</p>
<h4><strong><u>Non-Neighbour Disputes</u></strong></h4>
<p>If voluntary remediation does not materialise, you may choose to explore
other options to address the dispute, which may include seeking legal advice
or proceeding to file an application with the Courts.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Neighbour Disputes from Tampines (During Pilot Phase)</u></strong></h4>
<p>If voluntary remediation does not materialise because the Respondent declines
or fails to respond, you can apply for Directed Remediation by calling
the MinLaw Enquiry Line at 1800 2255 529* during office hours. This means
attendance at a CMC mediation session is compulsory for both parties.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Neighbour Disputes from all other Towns (During Pilot Phase)</u></strong></h4>
<p>If voluntary remediation does not materialise because the Respondent declines
or fails to respond, we will issue you with an outcome letter. You have
the option to file a claim at the CDRT.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Non-neighbour Disputes</u></strong></h4>
<p>If remediation does not materialise, you may choose to explore other options
to address the dispute, which may include seeking legal advice or proceeding
to file an application with the Courts.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Neighbour Disputes from Tampines (During Pilot)</u></strong></h4>
<p>If remediation does not materialise because the Respondent declines or
fails to respond, you can apply for Directed Remediation by calling the
MinLaw Enquiry Line at 1800 2255 529* during office hours. This means attendance
at a CMC mediation session is compulsory for both parties.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Neighbour Disputes from all other Towns (During Pilot)</u></strong></h4>
<p>If remediation does not materialise because the Respondent declines or
fails to respond, we will issue you with an outcome letter. You have the
option to file a claim at the CDRT.</p>

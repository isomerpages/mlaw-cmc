<p>If you encounter post-mediation issues, you can apply for remediation
through our online application <a href="https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/cmc/mediatorsportal/direct-intake/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>form</u></a>,
one month from the last mediation session. You can also call the MinLaw
Enquiry Line at 1800 2255 529* during office hours.</p>
<p><strong><u>Non-neighbour Disputes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>If remediation does not materialise, you may choose to explore other options
to address the dispute, which may include seeking legal advice or proceeding
to file an application with the Courts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Neighbour Disputes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>If remediation does not materialise, you have the option of filing a claim
at the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT).</p>

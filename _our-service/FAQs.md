<blockquote>
<h4>Can the CMC accept cases involving neighbour disputes in private condominium or landed property?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>We accept cases involving neighbour disputes both in public and private
estates which include landed properties, condominiums and private apartments.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<h4>Why is the CMC accepting a mediation application without carrying out any investigations?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The CMC does not carry out investigations. Our primary focus is on facilitating
discussions between disputing parties.</p>
<p>Through mediation, we aim to help parties communicate effectively, explore
solutions and reach mutually beneficial agreements.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<h4>Do I need evidence to lodge a case with the CMC?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>You do not have to produce any evidence before applying for mediation
at the CMC.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<h4>How many people can attend the mediation session?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Excluding family disputes, we allow up to two persons from each party,
who are directly involved with the dispute, to attend the mediation session.</p>
<p>For a satellite mediation session, only one person from each party will
attend the session.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<h4>Can I get my family members/agent to attend the mediation session on my behalf?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>If your family member or agent has been issued with a Power of Attorney
to manage your affairs, you can authorise them to attend the session on
your behalf.</p>
<p>For all other reasons, please contact us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <strong>Court-Directed </strong>Mediation, only parties named in the
Order of Court will attend the mediation session.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<h4>Can I get a lawyer to attend the mediation with me?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>At the CMC, lawyers are not allowed to attend the mediation sessions with
the parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you require legal advice, it is advisable to seek it separately before
the mediation session.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>If the Respondent ignores or declines the CMC invitation, what are my other options? Can I bring the case up to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT)?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>For voluntary mediation, we can only proceed to arrange a mediation session
when both parties are willing to participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Non-Neighbour Disputes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>If the Respondent declines or fails to respond to a mediation invitation,
you may choose to explore other options to address the dispute, which may
include seeking legal advice or proceeding to file an application with
the Courts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Neighbour Disputes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>If the Respondent declines or fails to respond to a mediation invitation,
you have the option of filing a claim at the Community Disputes Resolution
Tribunal (CDRT).</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Can I record the mediation session?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>The mediation at the CMC is a confidential process, as outlined in the
CMC Act, Cap 49A.</p>
<p>To maintain confidentiality and to provide a safe space for parties to
share without fear, no photography, videography or audio recording is allowed
during the mediation session.</p>
<p>Should we realise that a recording has taken place, the party responsible
will be asked to delete the content, in the presence of the mediators or
the CMC officer.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<h4>Is a CMC Settlement Agreement legally binding?</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Once a Settlement Agreement is signed, it is binding on the parties who
signed it, which means that you can use the document as evidence to support
legal proceedings.</p>
